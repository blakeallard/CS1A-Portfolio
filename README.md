This portfolio showcases a series of projects completed in the CS1A course, which focuses on introducing foundational concepts in C++ programming. These projects demonstrate various skills, including basic syntax, control structures, functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming. Each project is designed to reinforce and apply the principles learned throughout the course.

Key Features:
Basic Programming Concepts: Projects include examples of variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

Control Flow: Demonstrates the use of if-else statements, switch cases, and loops to control the flow of the program.

Arrays: Uses arrays to store and manipulate multiple values in a single variable.

Functions: Emphasizes function creation, calling, and passing parameters.

Input and Output: Various projects involve taking user input and displaying results to the console.

Skills Demonstrated:
Basic Syntax: Understanding C++ syntax, including variable declaration, operators, and basic data types.

Control Structures: Use of conditional statements and loops to execute specific tasks based on user input.

Arrays and Data Management: Storing and manipulating large sets of data using arrays.

Functions and Modularity: Creating reusable and organized code by breaking tasks into separate functions.

Debugging and Testing: Ensuring correctness by testing programs and identifying logical errors.

Each project demonstrates the application of core C++ concepts and serves as an important step in mastering the language.
